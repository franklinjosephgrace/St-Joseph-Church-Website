								<h2>Altar Servers</h2>
								<p align="justify">Altar Servers assist at Mass and other liturgical celebrations to help promote a prayerful, inviting gathering of worshipers. Young persons who serve are in grades 4 and above and need the ability to assist various liturgical ministers prayerfully and reverently.

								<p>They meet on Tuesday evenings at 7:30 PM in the Church Campus.</p>

								<h2>Sunday Catechism</h2>
								<p align="justify">The Catechism of the Catholic Church is a teaching tool. It is a concise explanation of Catholic beliefs. The Catechism includes quotations from many papal encyclicals, church council documents, and the Scriptures. It refers to these as reference points for Catholic teachings. Although it is important, the Catechism is not considered a sacred text like the Bible. In fact, the Catechism we have now is fairly recent, although it describes ancient beliefs. The catechism helps to consolidate all of the Churchâ€™s teachings into a handy reference.</p>

								<h2>Role of the Sponsors/Godparents</h2>
								<p align="justify">The role of the sponsor or Godparent is, "together with the parents, to present an infant at baptism, and help the baptized to lead a Christian life in harmony with baptism, and to fulfill faithfully the obligations connected with it." (Canon 872)  In the beginning of the Rite of Baptism of Children, the Godparents are asked if they are willing to help the parents of the one baptized in their duties as Christian parents. Thus, the function of the Godparents is not merely ceremonial or social but to assist the parents in raising their child in the practice of the faith.</p>
