										<h2>A brief History</h2>

										<p align="justify">This Parish was established in the year 1857 and blessed by the French Missionaries (MEP Fathers) and in fact K.K. Pudur was one of the oldest Parishes in the Archdiocese of Mylapore. From 1896, the MEP fathers had developed it into a very dynamic Mission. In 1899 it was made into a Parish. Many priests were staying at K.K. Pudur to look after the villages around. The people who were converted in Andra, came here and settled in these villages. Again in 1903 this become a substation of Madurantakam along with Thatchoor and Valayaputhur (Vedanthangal). The newly built present Church was blessed on 1st May, 2006 by Most Rev. Dr. A. Neethinathan</p>
